# Assignment 2 - Two Wheeled Mobile Robot
This is a simple, two-wheeled robot that is coded and developed by *Natnael Berhanu Takele*.

## Assignment Description
The two-wheeled mobile robot that will be used in this assignment moves in three dimensions by avoiding obstacles in order to reach the target position. A 3D simulation environment called Gazebo allows the user to operate the robot.

The implementation of an action server that moves a two-wheeled mobile robot in the given environment uses the concept of the bug0 algorithm.

Bug0 Algorithm:
- head toward goal
- follow obstacles until you can head toward the goal again
- continue
